This is a python application that I use to control the lightning decoration in a set of LEGO constructions.


Requirements

- Setuptools (for automatic installation)
- arduino-python


Installation
------------
> python setup.py install


Usage

In order to run legovillage, a configuration file (legovillage.json) must exist inside the current directory.
